# Bloc Jams
A web based media player application coded using the jQuery framework library.
## Features
* Web-based simplicity
* Click on a file to start, click again to pause
* Skip to a new song or go back to a previous song with the playback controls 
* Slider controls on the playback progress bar allow users to skip ahead in the song
* Slider controls for volume allow precise control of audio amplitude

If you have some missing fonts that are available for free download (i.e on Google Fonts), FontBuddy will display a tiny message. Click it to see & install missing fonts. That’s it.
